Well, it wasn't pleasure, I haven't seen so far a bit of Madrid but I'm quite confident in installing Cloudera AND that was probably the purpose of the training.

Only one thing I was a bit missing and it's actually troubleshooting of potentail issues, main logs to check best practices on follow-up actions. But otherwise it was nice training I wish "Cloudera administrator" would be a bit like this.
